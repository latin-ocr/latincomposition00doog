FOR VVRITTEN TRANSLATION. BOOK VII, 71, 72

Before the Romans completed their fortifications, Ver-
cingetorix dismissed his cavalry in the second watch and
ordered them, departing, to go each man to his own state
and beg that they send all their forces for the common
safety of Gaul, and not surrender 80,ooo picked men to
the enemy. He1 had a large supply of cattle, but corn for
scarcely thirty days. The former² he divided, the latter2
he 3had brought to him and measured it out sparingly.
But4 Caesar began to construct immense works. First⁵
he surrounded the whole town with a twenty-foot ditch,
then,6 leaving a space of four hundred feet, he dug two
other ditches fifteen feet wide, and the inner one of these .
he filled with water. Behind these was a wall of earth
and a rampart twelve feet high.
