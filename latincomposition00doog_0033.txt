LESSON XXXII
FOR WRITTEN TRANSLATION. BOOK ΙΙ, 30, 31

At first the Aduatuci made frequent sallies from the town
in order to skirmishl with 2our forces, and afterwards when
they had been surrounded by the rampart, they mocked us
3because such little men were setting up a tower at such
a distance from the wall3 but when they saw it moving,
greatly terrified they sent ambassadors to seek peace, for
they thought that the Romans carried on war with the
help of the gods. The ambassadors begged besides⁴ that
Caesar would show them mercy ⁵and not deprive them of
their arms.
