PREFACE

Tffls book of exercises in Latin Composition is designed
to accompany the Caesar selections in “Second Year
Latinss'* A sufficient amount of material has been pre-
pared for drill in composition during the Caesar year.

Following the method most in vogue, the exercises are
based on the text for vocabulary, idioms‚ and general
principles of sentence structure. In the presentation of
the syntax, however, an important departure has been
made, which will, I trust, commend itself to thoughtful
teachers. Instead of following the chance or caprice of
the text, the syntax has been presented in a systematic and
orderly manner. The constructions in the special parts of
the text upon which the respective exercises are based, are
used only so far as they fit into this plan. The knowledge
of syntax which comesto pupils from reading an author,
or by repeating in prose composition the constructions as
found in the text, is analytic and partial in its character,
and needs to be crystallized by a synthetic study of syn-
tactical principles. My experience has been that pupils
are not able to synthesize this analytic knowledge for
themselves3 and that while having a fairly good knowledge
of different parts, they do not know the subject as a whole,
nor the relations of the parts to each other. It is hoped
that the following exercises will be found to possess such
advantages as are to be drawn from following the text, with
none of the disadvantages. They have been very carefully
