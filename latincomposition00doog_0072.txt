FoR WRITTEN TRANSLATION. BOOK VII, 12, 13

The inhabitants of Noviodunum had sent ambassadors
to Caesar 1to beg that he spare their lives‚2 and he had
already demanded hostages and had sent some centurions
and soldiers into the town to search for weapons, when the
cavalry of Vercingetorix was seen in the distance. The
Gauls in the town, as soon as they beheld this, raising a
shou‘c, seized3 their arms, closed 3 the gates, and manned 3
the wall. Caesar without delay4 led forth his German
horsemen, whom he had had with him for many years, and
easily put the enemy to ssight, some being‘ lost and others
retreating to Vercingetorix. Thereupon5 the townspeople
surrendered a second time, and a few hours later6 Caesar
was on his way to Avaricum, which was at that time the
largest town of the Bituriges.
