LESSON XII
FOR VVRITTEN TRANSLATION. BOOK ΙΙ, 9

Neither Caesar nor the enemy were willing1 to cross the
little swamp which lay2 between the two armies, 3and so
Caesar led his men back into camp. But the enemy
straightway hastened to the fords of the Axona, which was
the river behind the camp, and tried to take by storm the
redoubt over which Titurius, the lieutenant, had command,
and to destroy the bridge. 4If this was done, they could5
lay waste the fields of the Remi and cut off Caesar's supplies.
