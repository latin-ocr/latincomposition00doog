LESSON XL

FOR WRITTEN TRANSLArioN. BOOK ΙΙΙ, 12

The ships of the Veneti were well fitted 1to withstand
the waves and tempests of the ocean. They were made
entirely of oak and had skins for sails, 2so that they might
endure the violence of the winds more easily. 3Thus it
followed that our ships excelled only in speed and rowing,4
but that theirs5 were better adapted to the character of
the place. An added fact was that on account of their
great strength 6they could not⁷ be injured by ramming
nor⁷ did they sear the rocks and the shallows which were
an Sobject of sear to us. .
