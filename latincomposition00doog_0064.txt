The following essential points of difference between the
gerund and gerundive may be of service to beginners.

1. The gerund is a verbal noun, the gerundive a verbal
adjective.

2. The gerund, being a verbal noun, may stand alone or with
an object.

3. The gerundivc as a verbal adjective is used only in agree-
ment with a noun.

4. As a rule, only the genitive of the gerund and the ablative
without a preposition admit 3 direct object. In other caseS, and
often in the former, the gerundive construction is preferred.

5. To change a gerund with 3 direct object into the correspond-
ing gerundive construction, put the direct object in the case of the
gertrud, and use the gerundive in adjective agreement with it.
