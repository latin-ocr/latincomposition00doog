FOR WRITTEN TRANSLATION. BOOK VII, 18, 19

When Caesar heard that Vercingetorix and his cavalry ⁵
had set out 1for the place where he thought our men would
come the next day to get fodder, he himself with part of his
own2 troops set out at midnight for the camp of the enemy.
The Gauls were holding a hill which was surrounded on all
sides by a swamp about3 fifty feet4 wide, and were ready
to overwhelm the Romans if any of them should attempt
to break through the fords. Caesar quickly saw the
inequality of the conditions, and showed his soldiers, who,
eager5 for victory, were demanding the signal for battle,
sshow much the victory would necessarily cost; and the
same day led them back into camp. It was (characteristic)
of Caesar to hold the lives⁷ of his men dearer than his
own2 glory.
