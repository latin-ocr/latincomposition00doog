LESSON IV
FOR VVRITTEN TRANSLATION. BOOK ΙΙ, 2

When Caesar was informed by Labienus that the Belgae
were giving hostages to each other, he feared that they
took it ill that the Roman army was passing the winter in
Gaul, and that, 1with their usual² fickleness of mind, they
were conspiring3 against the Roman people. He thought,
therefore,4 that he ought to advance without delay, and,
⁵after enrolling two legions in hither Gaul, arrived with
his army in the territory of the Belgae. He employed the
Senones to keep him informed about matters.6
