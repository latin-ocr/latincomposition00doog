iv PREFACE

graded in point of difficulty and are for both oral and
written work.

EXERCISES FOR ORAL TRANSLA‘HON. Three exercises
for oral translation precede each one for written work.
The sentences have been made as simple as possible, and,
while using the vocabulary and idioms of the text, aim to
exemplify the principles of syntax set forth in the accom-
panying grammar lessons. These principles are in every
case still furtherlexemplified in the exercises that immedi-
ately follow. The largest space has been given to the
constructions that are the most important, such as the
Subjunctive in Final and in Consecutive Clauses‚ Condi-
tional Sentences, Indirect Discourse‚ etc. A few lessons
involving some of the more difficult or more unusual con-
structions have been marked with an asterisk, and may be
omitted at the discretion of the teacher. The work in
oral prose may be done most easily and profitably in con-
nection with each day’s review lesson.

EXERCISES FOR WRiTTEN TRANSLATION. The exercises
for written translation are in connected English narrative
and airn to review especially the grammatical principles
treated in the three preceding oral exercises, and to give
practice in writing connected Latin. They will not be
found too difficult after a careful study of the text.

A GRAMMATICAL INDEX has been added for convenience
of reference.
