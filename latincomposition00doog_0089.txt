thought was present to the mind of both parties that now
there was need of the greatest valor, and that the fruit of
all their former struggles rested upon that day and hour.
The Gauls, by the great number of their missiles, drove the
defenders from the towers‚ and fresh men constantly² took
the place of those who were exhausted. When Caesar knew
that 3his troops had no longer either arms or strength, he
sent six cohorts 4to their assistance and said: “ If you can't

to.'’ The Gauls on the inside, despairing of 311 safety‚ try
to break through the lines5 and use hurdles and dirt Gto fill
the trenches.
